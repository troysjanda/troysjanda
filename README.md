XPI's Filter List

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troysjanda/MyBlockLists/master/UBOXPI

A collection of personal filters from my daily web activity. These are uncatagorized and may cause breakage. If you find problems, or want to contribute please submit a pull request and ill review and merge.

Yahoo Complete annoyance blocking list

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troysjanda/MyBlockLists/master/yahoocomplete.txt

These filters help to reduce Yahoo tracking, Beacons, Pixel tracking, and ads making Yahoo a more cleaner experience. Note: Some filters can cause blank gaps in articles or sidebar this is unavoidable due in part to the way Yahoo obscures its div, classes in an effort to circumvent blockers.
