- 👋 Hi, I’m @troysjanda
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Ublock Orgin Filterlists
- 📫 How to reach me PM me.

I am a Ubo Filterliet maintainer for the XPI and the Yahoo Complete Filterlists. The XPI list is a general filterlist for annoyances around the web that i have encountered. The Yahoo Complete is a filterlist that removes all/most of the annoyances on the Yahoo site, which includes ads, beacons, bannars, and clickbate articles that seem like real articles but are ads. Please submit a bug report for filters that you feel should be included on either list. Make sure that the filter does not already exsist.
